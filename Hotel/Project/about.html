                <p>Urban elegance. Modern comfort. Style and grace. Hotel Emma, located in the heart of Pearl’s campus, has it all and then some. A 146-room boutique hotel, Emma’s extravagance of the iconic 19th century Brew House, as well as the shirtsleeve
                    industrial aesthetic of the brewery’s back rooms, make it a gem of a property. Our restaurant, Supper, bar, Sternewirth, catering and in-room dining experiences enhance Pearl’s reputation as a center of culinary discovery and have
                    allowed us to establish Hotel Emma as a chef-led culinary destination in its own right. Grab quick eats at Larder and check out a book from the library’s vintage card system, housed in one of the Brewhouse’s vaulted rooms. Come explore
                    the grounds, see the sights and experience the magic of Hotel Emma, where visible history meets South Texas grandeur and unpretentious function.</p>
